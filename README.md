To deploy this repository, make sure you have mongo client installed on your computer and that its connected to local host server (mongodb://localhost:27017) for record capture. The program automatically creates a database called my_database_name  in the mongo client.
If MongoClient is being flagged use the zipped vendor file and replace the current one
If the MongoClient is still being flagged after using the zipped vendor folder,request for a new vendor folder from author.
